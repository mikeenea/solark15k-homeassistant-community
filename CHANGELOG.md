### Known validation items

- Battery power sign convention requires live validation.
- Battery current sign convention requires live validation.
- Battery temperature encoding should be confirmed against current firmware.
- Parallel-inverter register semantics require field classification before aggregation.
- Lifetime energy 32-bit word handling should be compared to inverter totals during commissioning.

### Changed

- Corrected the integration documentation URL.
- Standardized documentation on the production `sol_ark_15k_1_*` and `sol_ark_15k_2_*` namespaces.
- Converted the installation checklist from site-specific status reporting to a reusable public checklist.

## Versioning plan

No stable semantic version has been assigned yet.

Proposed progression:

```text
0.1.0 -> first inverter validated
0.2.0 -> second inverter validated
0.3.0 -> parallel aggregation validated
0.4.0 -> InfluxDB/Grafana baseline complete
1.0.0 -> stable read-only dual-Sol-Ark 15K release
```
