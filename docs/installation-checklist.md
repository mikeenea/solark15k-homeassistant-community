# Installation Checklist

Use this as a print-friendly commissioning checklist for the physical build.

This checklist is intentionally installation-neutral. Use sections A-I for one inverter. For two parallel inverters, also complete sections J-L. The complete instructions are in [deployment-guide.md](deployment-guide.md).

## A. Pre-installation

- [ ] Record inverter #1 serial number.
- [ ] Record inverter #2 serial number.
- [ ] Record inverter firmware versions.
- [ ] Record parallel master/slave roles.
- [ ] Record Parallel-screen Modbus SN values for reference only.
- [ ] Confirm battery communication protocol is CAN.
